<h1>My first react app</h1>

This project is implemented to show my learned skills in React after passing the course organised by one company.
Here I used some basic hooks and packages like: UseState, UseEffect, React Router, UseParams, UseLocation, SweetAlert etc.

The Test-app can do CRUD operations with articles.
User can create article, update article content, delete article and user can see full view of an article.
There is also contact page with inputs for name,email and message.
There is implemented validation for user inputs, so email input needs to be in right form (validation using reg ex) and other inputs can not be empty.
